3. A data scientist uses a dataset with five categories. One category has 500 items. The
other categories have fewer than 50 items each. To adjust the data, they add data to
the smaller sets. What is this type of adjustment?

4. Which statement describes a sparse vector?
* Multiple categories with even distribution
* A large number of items with a value of zero (0)
* A large number of non-zero (0) values
* The optimal vector for making inferences

        answer: A large number of items with a value of zero (0)

5. What is gradient boosting?
* An algorithm that increases the number of iterations that are needed to
increase the accuracy of a model
* An algorithm that reduces the number of iterations that are needed to
increase the accuracy of a model
* An algorithm that makes a model more predictable
* An algorithm that increases the processing speed of a model

        answer: An algorithm that reduces the number of iterations that are needed to increase the accuracy of a model.

vectors, train a classifier, use metrics to tune the model
* Collect labeled dataset, normalize the data, transform text into feature
vectors, use metrics to tune the model, train a classifier
* Collect labeled dataset, normalize the data, transform text into feature
vectors, train a classifier, use metrics to tune the model
