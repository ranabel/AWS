2. A data engineer is considering a new database or their organization. Which actors
should they consider? (Select THREE.)
    * Strong identity
    * Data shape
    * Application workload
    * Whether the database is fully managed
    * Performance requirements of the application
    * Traceability of data

        answer: Data shape & Application workload & Performance requirements of the application

    * Amazon DynamoDB
    * Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility)
    * Amazon Neptune
    * Amazon Aurora

        answer: Amazon Aurora

7. Which descriptions are characteristics of a data warehouse? (Select THREE.)
    * Has data written to it at the time of analysis (schema on read)
    * Offers faster query results but uses higher cost storage than a data lake
    * Stores nonrelational and relational data from Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
        websites, mobile apps, social media, and corporate applications
    * Stores relational data from transactional systems, operational databases, and line-
        of-business applications
    * Offers faster query results but uses lower cost storage than a data lake
    * Is designed prior to the implementation (schema on write)

        answer: Offers faster query results but uses higher cost storage than a data lake & Stores relational data from transactional systems, operational databases, and line-of-business applications. & Is designed prior to the implementation (schema on write).

8. A data engineer would like to create a data warehouse in AWS for their business
intelligence (Bl) needs. Which service could they use to accomplish this task?
    * Amazon DynamoDB
    * Amazon S3
    * Amazon RDS
    * Amazon Redshift

        answer: Amazon Redshift

9. A data engineer needs a database that is designed for scale, with data being split
across multiple storage nodes. They want to ensure that as their data grows, additional
storage nodes can be added. Which type of database could the data engineer
implement?
    * Relational
    * Graph
    * Key-value or wide-column
    * Document

        answer: Key-value or wide-column

10. A data engineer wants to quickly set up a secure data lake. They want to import data
from MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle databases that are running
in Amazon RDS. Which service could the data engineer use to accomplish this task?
    * Amazon Redshift Spectrum
    * Amazon Neptune
    * AWS Lake Formation
    * AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)

        answer: AWS Lake Formation
