## Module 

1. 
    A data scientist writes a program that applies rule-based logic to customer profile data to determine which customers are likely to respond to an advertisement. How would you categorize this type of analysis?

    Preventive analytics

    Machine learning (ML)

    Artificial intelligence (Al)

    Traditional analytics

        answer: Traditional analytics

2. 
    Which statement describes a key factor to design an effective decision-making infrastructure?

    The designer should start with the business problem to be solved and then build the pipeline that suits that use case.

    Every data pipeline should follow the same pattern of tasks and move directly from ingestion to storage to processing and then to analysis and visualization, sequentially.

    The designer should focus on collecting data and building a pipeline that can be used for all of the analytics in the organization.

    The design should prevent data from being transformed as it moves through the pipeline.

        answer: The designer should start with the business problem to be solved and then build the pipeline that suits that use case.

3. 
    A customer wants to create a website that highlights cars only. Because there are many different cars, the customer plans to train a model by showing it numerous pictures that are labeled as cars and letting it learn to identify unlabeled pictures as cars. Which data science approach could accomplish this task?

    Traditional analytics

    Natural language processing

    Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)

    Historical analysis

        answer: Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)

4. 
    Which statement accurately reflects how an organization should think about using its data to make decisions?

    An organization should always store as much data as possible to maximize value.

    A solution should never sacrifice accuracy for speed.

    Data becomes more valuable for decision-making over time.

    Preventive and predictive analytics promise the most value when compared to other types of analytics.

        answer: Preventive and predictive analytics promise the most value when compared to other types of analytics.

5. 
    Which statement best describes the data scientist role in processing data through a pipeline?

    A data scientist focuses on granting the correct level of access to different types of users.

    A data scientist works on moving data into the pipeline.

    A data scientist focuses on the infrastructure that data passes through.

    A data scientist works with data in the pipeline.

        answer: A data scientist works with data in the pipeline.

6. 
    Which statement describes how data is processed through the pipeline?

    After the selected data sources have been ingested into the pipeline, it would be unlikely for additional iterations to involve new data sources.

    Processing will almost always be iterative.

    The ingestion step of the pipeline might be iterative, but after data is stored to be processed, iterations rarely occur.

    Processing should almost never be iterative.

        answer: Processing will almost always be iterative.

7.
    Which statement is true regarding how data might be acted upon as it passes through a pipeline? (Select TWO.)

    Data might need to be cleaned or normalized.

    Data will probably be transformed through some type of extract, transform, and load (ETL) process.

    All data that is ingested into the pipeline will be enriched.

    Extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes are not used in analytics pipelines.

    Data that passes through the pipeline will be transformed only once, and this will occur during the ingestion phase.

        answer: Data might need to be cleaned or normalized & Data will probably be transformed through some type of extract, transform, and load (ETL) process

8.
    What is the data engineer's role in processing data through a pipeline?

    Evaluate the results.

    Build the infrastructure that the data passes through.

    Train data analysts on analysis and visualization tools.

    Look for additional insights in the data.

        answer: Build the infrastructure that the data passes through.

9.
    Which statement represents a strategy that is suggested for innovating with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)?

    Take advantage of cloud services with AI/ML features that democratize access.

    To protect your investment, limit ML activities to data scientists who have significant expertise with ML.

    Expect a significant investment to train analysts to use new tools and abandon older, familiar tools, such as SQL.

    Focus on structured data where you can be more certain of the outcomes.

        answer: Take advantage of cloud services with AI/ML features that democratize access.

10.
    Which statement best describes the unify part of the three-pronged strategy to build modern data infrastructures?

    Break down silos and democratize access.

    Centrally control access to data.

    Migrate to purpose-built tools and data stores.

    Use artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) to discover new insights faster.

        answer: Break down silos and democratize access.
