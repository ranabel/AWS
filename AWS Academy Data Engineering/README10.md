## Module 

1. A data scientist who works for a healthcare company wants to develop an ML model to
predict which patients are likely to develop hypertension. One data source includes
anonymized tabular data with fields including age, weight, activity_level, and smoker.
Which statement describes how this data fits into an ML model?
* Age, weight, and activity_level are targets.
* Age, weight, and activity_level are labels.
* Age, weight, and activity_level are samples.
* Age, weight, and activity_level are features.

        answer: * Age, weight, and activity_level are features.

2. Which statement about the ML lifecycle reflects typical role assignments?
* The data scientist works with ML engineers to frame the ML problem.
* The data engineer is primarily concerned with developing the ML model.
* The data engineer is primarily focused on data collection.
* The data engineer works with the ML engineer to deploy the ML model.

        answer: * The data engineer is primarily focused on data collection.

3. The sales department has asked the data science team to build an ML model to help
them predict which customers to target for a new product line. Which reason might
prevent them from choosing an ML approach?
* A lot of variables might influence behaviors.
* The current approach to predict behaviors by using business intelligence tools
takes too long to achieve the desired level of accuracy.
* The sales team has a limited amount of data about customer behaviors.
* Patterns of behavior are unclear, and business rules cannot be hard-coded.

        answer: * The sales team has a limited amount of data about customer behaviors.

4. A company wants to collect data to be used in a supervised learning ML model to
predict which club benefits increase customer retention in a shopping club. The data
scientist has identified a potential data source within the company's internal databases.
Which task would likely be the responsibility of the data engineer?
* Evaluate the integrity of the data source that the data scientist suggested.
* Determine which columns to use as features.
* Determine which algorithm to use based on the data source that the data scientist
suggested.
* Determine how to split the data source into training and test datasets for the data
scientist to use.

        answer: * Evaluate the integrity of the data source that the data scientist suggested.

5. What is a common strategy for the preprocessing phase of the ML lifecycle?
* Balance and unbias the data.
* Train the model.
* Monitor model outputs.
* Extract features.

        answer: * Balance and unbias the data.
---

6. A data scientist is working with a dataset that has high dimensionality. Which approach
might they take to improve the dataset for their ML model?
* Create new features to augment existing ones.
* Increase the dimensionality by using feature extraction.
* Use binning to create a fixed number of values for a feature.
* Identify features that do not appear to impact outcomes and remove them.

        answer: * Identify features that do not appear to impact outcomes and remove them.

7. A company is starting an ML project to predict whether a given credit card transaction
appears to be fraudulent. What should their ML architect keep in mind when designing
the model development and deployment infrastructure?
* Training a model generally requires much higher levels of compute than running a
deployed model.
* To ensure consistency between test and production environments, use the same
infrastructure to build and deploy the model.
* The model development environment will be optimized to deliver individual
predictions.
* The deployment environment will always need to support more parallel processing
than the modeling environment.

        answer: * Training a model generally requires much higher levels of compute than running a deployed model.

8. A data scientist in a startup organization is using several internal datasets to start a
project to experiment with ML. They do not have a data engineer, and the
infrastructure team does not have experience with running ML applications. Which
approach would help the data scientist to get started on this project?
* Use Amazon Elastic Inference with an Amazon EC2 P3 instance for model
development.
* Use an Amazon EC2 Infl instance type to host the model development
environment.
* Use AWS ParallelCluster to simplify deployment of a high performance computing
(HPC) environment.
* Use Amazon SageMaker features to perform model development.

        answer: * Use Amazon SageMaker features to perform model development.

9. A business analyst wants to use a CSV file that they built to test a hypothesis about
predicting an outcome. Which approach can simplify their work?
* Use Amazon SageMaker Canvas.
* Use an AWS Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI).
* Load the data into Amazon EMR.
* Load the data into Amazon RedShift.

        answer: * Use Amazon SageMaker Canvas.

10. Which AWS service is an artificial intelligence (Al) coding companion that generates
whole line and full function code suggestions in an integrated development
environment (IDE)?
* AWS Inferentia
* Amazon Q Developer
* Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
* Amazon Bedrock

        answer: * Amazon Q Developer
