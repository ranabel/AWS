4. 
    You have a preprocessed dataset that's ready for use in training a model. How should you divide your training data?

    Use all the data to train the model.

    Split the data into two equal sets. Use one half for training and the other half for testing.

    Split the data into three sets. Use 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation.

    Split the data into two sets. Use 80% for training, and 20% for testing and validation.

        answer: Split the data into three sets. Use 80% for training, 10% for testing, and 10% for validation.
