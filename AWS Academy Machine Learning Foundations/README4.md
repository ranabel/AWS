4. 
    You have a dataset of temperature readings from a weather station. Temperature readings are logged every 5 minutes. You notice that there are several missing values each day. Which approach could you take? (Select TWO.)

    Replace the missing values with zer

    Forward fill the missing values

    Backward fill the missing values

    Use the sum of the temperatures for the day to fill the missing values

    Remove the records that have the missing data

        answer: Forward fill the missing values and Backward fill the missing values

    Quarterly, yearly

    Spring, summer, fall, winter

    Every two years

7. 
    An Amazon SageMaker Canvas forecast model generates predictions for PIO, P50, and P90. If the forecast predicts shoe sales, what do the PIO, P50, and P90 tell you?

    PIO indicates that 10% of the time, fewer than the predicted value will be ordered.

    P50 indicates that 50% of the time, the exact number of the predicted value will be ordered.

    P90 indicates that 90% of the time, more than the predicted value will be ordered.

    The average of PIO, P50, and P90 indicates the exact number of predicted value that will be ordered.

        answer:  PIO indicates that 10% of the time, fewer than the predicted value will be ordered.

    Item data that includes an item and category

    Item stock information that includes a timestamp, item, and stock quantity
V
    Item pricing data including a timestamp, item and price

    Time series data that includes a timestamp, item, and quantity

        answer: Time series data that includes a timestamp, item, and quantity

9.
    Amazon SageMaker Canvas provides various evaluation metrics for forecasting models. What is the benefit of column impact scores ?

    Column impact scores provide probable predictions to show how much uncertainty is associated with a forecast.

    Column impact scores show forecast reliability by comparing target and forecasted values.

    Column impact scores show how much an attribute contributes to the model's forecast.

    Column impact scores show model's forecast accuracy.

        answer:  Column impact scores show how much an attribute contributes to the model's forecast.
