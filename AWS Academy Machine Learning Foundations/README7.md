## Module 7 - Introducing Generative AI

1. 
    After defining generative artificial intelligence (generative Al), a company begins brainstorming how they can use the technology for their engineering application. The chief technology officer (C TO) asks for some clarification on how the technology works. Which statement best describes how generative Al works?

    Generative Al is based on users labeling data and training a model.

    Generative Al is powered by large machine learning models called foundation models (FMs). With FMs, customers can use the same pretrained model to adapt to multiple tasks

    Generative Al is governed by a set of rules defined by the user.

    Generative Al is based on users deploying a model.

        answer: Generative Al is powered by large machine learning models called foundation models (FMs). With FMs, customers can use the same pretrained model to adapt to multiple tasks
